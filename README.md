# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Background

The fictional company, Pewlett Hackard, boasts several thousand employees and has been in business for many years. Consequently, the company believes that a large number of its employees will soon be retiring. Pewlett Hackard need to be prepared, so they have developed the following two strategies: first, retirement packages will be offered for employees who meet certain criteria, and second, thousands of job openings will need to be filled. To help implement these strategies, we have been given six csv files containing employee information, and we will need to create a database using pgAdmin and PostgresSQL to perform our analysis.

### Purpose

In this analysis, we are preparing the following deliverables for our manager:

1. A list of employees who are eligible for retirement
2. The number of employees who are eligible for retirement
3. A list of employees containing their unique employee number, their last name, first name, gender, and salary
4. A list of managers for each department
5. A list of employees retiring from either the Sales department of the Development department

Furthermore, in the challenge analysis, we are preparing these deliverables:

1. The number of retiring employees by title
2. A list of employees who are eligible for the mentorship program
3. Counts of the number of mentorship-eligible employees by title
4. A list of managers who are retiring

With these deliverables, our manager will be able to prepare for the incoming wave of retiring employees.

## Results

From Deliverable 1

- Two managers are retiring
- Many Senior Engineers and Senior Staff are retiring, around 50,000 employees total.

From Deliverable 2

- There are 1,549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program
- Many of the employees who are eligible are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff

## Summary

1. By examining Table 1, we see that among the different departments, there are over 30,000 empty positions that may need to be filled, across seven different job titles.
2. From our results list, there are 1,549 employees who are retirement-ready and eligilbe for the Mentorship Program. However, there are over 30,000 current employees who getting ready for retirement. Thus, even if each mentorship-eligible employee stayed with the company and joined the mentorship program, each mentor would be responsible for a minimum of 20 mentees! Thus, there are not enough qualified employees to mentor the next generation.

All in all, when the baby boomers retire, a major gap will need to be filled at Pewlett-Hackard. Luckily, our analysis will help the executive team weather the incoming storm. Please see below for screenshots of the deliverables.

# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this analysis, we are preparing the following deliverables for our manager:
    1. Determining the Number of Retiring Employees by Title, and
    2. Identifying the Employees who are Eligible for the Mentorship Program

With these two deliverables, our manager will be able to prepare for the incoming wave of retiring employees.

## Results
From Deliverable 1
* Only 2 Managers are retiring
* Many Senior Engineers and Senior Staff are retiring: around 50,000 combined

From Deliverable 2
* There are 1,549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program
* Many of the employees who are eligible are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff 

## Summary
1. By examining Table 1, we see that among the different departments, there are seven different roles that will need to be filled. 
2. From our results list, there are 1,549 employees who are retirement-ready and eligilbe for the Mentorship Program. However, there are 50,000+ employees who getting ready for retirement. Thus, even if each eligible employee stayed with the company and joined the mentorship program, each mentor would likely have 30 mentees! Thus, there are not enough qualified employees to mentor the next generation.
